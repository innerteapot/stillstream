<h2>About StillStream</h2>
<p>
	StillStream is a USA-based zero-revenue non-commercial station, which means exactly that: we do not run
	advertising, nor receive revenue, nor do we have a traditional 'business model'.  StillStream is not,
	however, a legal non-profit organization.  In fact, StillStream is a privately
	owned station, not a corporation or other legal entity.  Therefore, please do
	not send donations, as they will not be tax deductible.  If you feel strongly about
	supporting StillStream and our efforts to promote ambient music, then we suggest
	you purchase one of the excellent StillStream related benefit releases from
	<a title="Blue Water Records" href="http://bluewaterrecords.com">Blue Water Records</a>.
</p>

<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
<p>
	StillStream provides its music to our listeners as a free and anonymous service.  However, any
	rebroadcast of our streams or any of our content is expressly prohibited.
	Note that you may be able to redistribute the music of some of the artists we play,
	depending upon the license that the artist has chosen to release their music
	under (for example <a title="Creative Commons" href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative
	Commons</a>), but the StillStream stream itself is not redistributable without
	prior written permission.  This is to preserve the rights of any artists who
	have granted StillStream a license-free waiver but have not released their
	music under a blanket license like Creative Commons.
</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>
	StillStream has always been totally dedicated to ensuring that the rights of
	all artists and any associated copyright holders are protected.  We work very
	hard to ensure that the music we play is either freely available for non-commercial use
	or that we have proper legal rights to broadcast it through our station.
	It is our firm policy to maintain compliance with all aspects of USA
	intellectual property law, with no exceptions.
	We are human, however, and sometimes mistakes are made.
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, if you are an artist or copyright holder and believe that we are
	broadcasting any of your protected work without proper permission, please
	<a title="How To Reach Us" href="contact.php">contact us</a> immediately, and we will work
	with you to resolve it right away.
</p>

<h2>Freedom Of Speech</h2>
<p>
	It is our policy to give broad freedom of speech to our radio hosts, in the
	true spirit of the Internet.  It is important, however, to remember that any
	opinions or statements by any of our hosts represent solely the
	opinions and statements of those individual hosts, not of StillStream at
	large or its owners or management.
</p>
<p>
	Also, our free speech policy acknowledges the fact that some speech, while
	legally protected, does not support the mission of our radio station.  For
	example, content that is racially insensitive or promotes criminal activity
	has no place on StillStream.  Therefore, StillStream reserves the right to
	moderate our content, and if necessary, to establish guidelines, at our sole
	discretion.
</p>
<p>
	While we tune into our own stream virtually every day, we cannot commit to
	actively monitoring every one of our hosts' broadcasts.  If you have any
	questions or concerns about this policy or about any specific host or program,
	please feel free to <a title="How To Reach Us" href="contact.php">contact us</a> and we will be
	happy to discuss it with you.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, guests in our chat room also enjoy the same broad freedom of speech,
	with the same caveat that certain types of speech do not support our mission
	and thus have no place here.  StillStream and its hosts reserve the right to
	moderate the discussion in our chatroom, and if necessary, to kick or ban users who
	will not follow our chat guidelines, at our sole discretion.

<h2>Age Appropriateness</h2>
<p>
	While StillStream respects the free speech rights of our hosts, we also respect
	the needs of parents to sometimes monitor what younger ears are listening to.
</p>
<p>
	Our programming, our chat room, and all of our content is, in general, geared
	towards adults.  In particular, the hosts of our live broadcasts are assuming
	that their audience is composed of adults. Additionally, we operate our station
	in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. As a result, children under 13
	should not tune in, and we recommend that teens under the age of 18 should not listen
	without parental guidance.  StillStream cannot be responsible if a minor
	hears something objectionable on our station.  As always, parents should
	actively exercise their best judgement when deciding whether to permit
	their minor children to tune in to our station.
